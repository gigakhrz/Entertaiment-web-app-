### What I learned

I have honed my skills in full-stack development, proficiently handling both front-end and back-end aspects. This includes robust user authentication and secure data storage. Leveraging React and TypeScript has significantly elevated the quality of my code. My mastery of Node.js for the backend has broadened my expertise in server-side programming and efficient data management. Implementing Redux for state management has empowered me to effectively handle complex application states. I excel in dynamic data handling, including adeptly filtering and presenting data for an enhanced user experience. Striking a balance between functionality and aesthetics, I've crafted an intuitive and user-friendly design.
